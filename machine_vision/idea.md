# Using Deep Learning for machine vision
Tags: automated machine vision inspection
Use a deep learning based machine vision system instead of using domain specific engineering and hand crafted features. Deal with newer defect types without having to spend much time into developing algorithms for them. Diversify into different industries. Greatly decrease your r&d cost and time.

Allows easy programmability by the end user in 

This will be the market validation framework we will use https://beaforceofgood.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/customer-validation-framework-and-process.png

## Application Domains
* Defects in screws / steel parts while manufacturing?
* Inspection of quality of tv screens?
* Quality of paintwork in automobiles?
* Inspection of banknotes while printing?
* Inspection of quality of pcb parts?
* Checking that pharmaceutical bottles are filled.
* Checking that water bottles are appropriately filled.
* Color confirmation to check that right capsule is in right packet

## Do
* Read a 
* Make a report of your own end to end machine vision system to offer to industry insiders
* Research and document more
* Find bitsian industry insiders
* Add idea here
* Make a launchrock page
* Do customer interviews

## Questions
* How big is the markets empirically?
* How useful is this for companies already having machine vision systems? Why would they go through the hassles to switch
* How much would they be willing to pay for this?
* How fast will this system work? How many parts/minute would it be able to process, how is that comparable to conventional systems?
* What extra hardware will be required for this to work?
* What all can it do?
* Would they be open to lease the technology?
* Who whould the industry insiders be in this case?
* Who would the customers be?
* Why would the industry insiders want to talk to you?
* Why would the customers want to talk to you?
* What all problems do they face? While dealing with customers? What all trends do they see?
* How much cost do manufacturing companies have to incur with defective goods? Need statistics on this.

## Why not humans?
People get tired and make mistakes. Plus their criteria of measurement is highly subjective unlike a machine vision system which carries out measurements with a pace set by the production process itself.

## How requirements are described
Type of fault, Size of fault, line speed,
