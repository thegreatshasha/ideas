# Circle, massively scalable p2p education network which transcends geographical barriers
# Circle: Peer to Peer education

## Thinklist
* Traditional systems are top down. Lots of inefficient layers involved which bleed out cash
* Circle is a system: comuunity, content, collaboration
* Can the whole k12 curriculum be mapped to a circle?
* A circle is a group of 4 learners who are working on the same problem
* Each problem should be large enough to hold the attention of the whole group
* What will the video classroom architecture be like?
* Forums etc to ask questions, omeagle like features to interact with other people in your network
* The members of the p2p network can help each other out who are struggling with a topic
* Track engagement within each circle, modify group if distribution is too skewed
* Have statistical metrics for group participation score, individual participation score. If the individual participation score in a group is too skewed, shift him to a different group
* Groups can also be formed via 

## Problems solved
* Education is expensive, Quality education even more so because costs of teachers salaries, buildings etc are factored in
* Without a suitable peer group, learning is much slower since isnights are not shared. Think 
* Students in remote locations find it really difficult to have access to quality educations
* Moocs are part of the solution but engagement in moocs is much less (only 5%) because of the lack of a peer group
* Current education system is push based instead of pull based, the whole curiosity factor is gone. A school teacher comes and starts teaching trignometry on the board.
